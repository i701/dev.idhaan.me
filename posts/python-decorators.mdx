## Function Decorators in Python

Function decorators are typically defined using the `@` symbol, followed by the name of the decorator function. When a decorated function is called, the decorator function is also called, allowing the decorator to modify the behavior of the original function.

Here is an example of a decorator that adds logging functionality to a function:

<CodeTitle title="Python" lang="py" />
```python def log_function_call(func): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): print(f"Calling {
  func.__name__
} with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}") return func(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper

@log_function_call
def my_function(x, y):
return x + y

my_function(2, 3)

```

In this example, the `log_function_call` decorator takes a function as input and returns a new function `(wrapper)` that logs the function call and then calls the original function. The `@log_function_call` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `my_function` function.

When `my_function` is called with arguments `(2, 3)`, the `log_function_call` decorator intercepts the call, logs the function call, and then calls the original `my_function` with the same arguments. The result (5) is then returned.

## Conclusion

Function decorators are a powerful feature of Python that allow you to add functionality to functions without modifying their source code. By defining a decorator function and using the `@` syntax to apply it to a function, you can easily extend or modify the behavior of any function in your code.
