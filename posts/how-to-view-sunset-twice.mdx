Okay there are 4 steps in total to do this.

> Note: my humor is broken i think

### Step 1

- Lay on your stomach on the beach like you lay on bed

### Step 2

- Wait until the sunsets

### Step 3

- Just when the sun is about to dissapear stand up really fast (don't complain about orthostatic hypotension or feeling dizzy)

### Step 4

- Boom! See the sunset again for the second time

## Conclusion

If you did not get sand on your chin then you probably did not do it correctly.
